								<p>
									Oozma Kappa was founded in the fall of 1987 by four wholesome members of the Monsters University Scaring Program. For many weeks, these monsters bonded over their lack of scariness. In the end, they somehow formed a bond of brotherhood and friendship that will last a lifetime. Oozma Kappa was once the smallest fraternity on the Monsters University campus. Since brother Mike Wazowski and brother James P. Sullivan joined, Oozma Kappa now has the same number of brothers as every other fraternity on campus. Oozma Kappa prides themselves on being unique members of the Scaring Program. What these brothers lack in scariness, they make up for it with passion, determination, and pure heart. Recently, the brothers of Oozma Kappa were named champions of the annual Scare Games.

									As the underdog winners of the annual Scare Games, Oozma Kappa was offered an exclusive cooperative program (co-op) with Monsters, Inc. Monsters, Inc. is the best, most profitable energy-producing factory in all of Monstropolis. Most monsters of the Scaring Program have dreamed of working at Monsters, Inc. since they were little monsters. Join Oozma Kappa and find out even more about this amazing opportunity!

								<p>
									Every fraternity and sorority on the Monsters University campus were founded on a set of principles that bonds members together for life and helps them stay focused on their goal of graduating from Monsters University. This set of principles allows each organization to attract future members that want to bond together for a common purpose. Oozma Kappaâ€™s purpose is to become the best scarers in the program and hopefully all of Monstropolis. The brothers of Oozma Kappa strive to live by these four values: scholarship, leadership, brotherhood, and scaring.
